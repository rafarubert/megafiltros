/**
 * This is a file to add template specific chrome to module rendering.  To use it you would
 * set the style attribute for the given module(s) include in your template to use the style
 * for each given modChrome function.
 *
 * eg.  To render a module mod_test in the sliders style, you would use the following include:
 * <jdoc:include type="module" name="test" style="slider" />
 *
 * This gives template designers ultimate control over how modules are rendered.
 *
 * NOTICE: All chrome wrapping methods should be named: modChrome_{STYLE} and take the same
 * two arguments.
